  If your account has been configured to limit the number of reviews you can
  receive, this value will never be higher than that. Otherwise, this value will
  show the total number of reviews available for this product. If there are more
  than 24 reviews available, you will need to use the
  [/product/reviews](../../../../openapi/reference/operation/productReviews) service
  to retrieve the remainder of the reviews.
