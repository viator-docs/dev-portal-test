  **number** of hours before the travel date that *this* product will be
  'on-request' for

  - this field will contain a value if the `bookingEngineId` is
  `'FreesaleOnRequestBE'`

  - an `onRequestPeriod` of 48 hours means that *this* product is freesale up
  until 48 hours before the travel date, and is on-request for 48 hours or less
  until the travel date

  - **note**: 'hours in advance' (the number of hours a product is available for
  booking before the travel date) may also affect this; however, this value is
  not available in the API
