                "descriptionText": "The Grand Canyon Skywalk is a glass, 70-foot long, open-air bridge suspended 4,000 feet above the canyon floor, providing 720-degree views. The Skywalk is operated by the Hualapai Tribe, which owns and protects more than one million acres of land throughout the Grand Canyon’s western rim. Even with its remote location some 120 miles from Las Vegas, you can easily experience the Grand Canyon Skywalk on a day trip or overnight excursion to the West Rim.",
                "showPhotos": false,
                "overviewSummary": "<div style=\"\">There’s no doubt that 4,000 feet (1,220 meters) is a long way down, especially when standing on a bridge made of glass—and you’re looking down toward the Grand Canyon floor. That’s the experience visitors find at the Grand Canyon Skywalk, a horseshoe-shaped, glass-bottomed bridge that juts out 70 feet (20 meters) above one of America’s most scenic sites. Travelers who step out onto the bridge are rewarded with panoramic West Rim and Colorado River views that extend 720 degrees, wrapping around, below, and behind.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"\"><br></div><div style=\"\"><b>The Basics</b></div><div style=\"\">Most tours to the Grand Canyon Skywalk begin in Las Vegas, where travelers head east to the Arizona desert by road, plane, or helicopter. A Skywalk ticket can be combined with a Hoover Dam trip or a scenic helicopter tour over the canyon, while other options include visits with Hualapai tribe members or a boat ride up the Colorado River. Those short on time can opt for a skip-the-line experience.</div><div style=\"\"><br></div><div style=\"\"><b>Things to Know Before You Go</b></div><div style=\"\"><ul><li>The Skywalk is a must-visit for thrill-seekers.<br></li><li>Cameras aren’t permitted on the Skywalk, but it is possible to purchase photos from Grand Canyon West’s professional photographers.<br></li><li>Outside food and drink are not permitted within Grand Canyon West or on the Skywalk.<br></li><li>Tours to the Skywalk can last upwards of nine hours depending on the option chosen.<br></li></ul></div><div style=\"\"><br></div><div style=\"\"><b>How to Get There</b></div><div style=\"\">McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas is the nearest commercial airport to the Skywalk bridge, about two hours away by road. Because the Grand Canyon Skywalk is a part of Grand Canyon West—a remote and rugged section of canyon managed by the Hualapai—entry to the bridge can only be purchased as part of a package excursion. While many visitors come on a guided tour, it’s also possible to drive yourself to Grand Canyon West, then take the hop-on, hop-off shuttle to the Skywalk and other attractions.</div><div style=\"\"><br></div><div style=\"\"><b>When to Get There</b></div><div style=\"\">Daytime temperatures at the Grand Canyon hover at or above 85°F (30­°C) in summer, making fall and spring much more appealing times to visit. The glass bridge tends to be busiest around midday, so plan to arrive in the morning or later in the afternoon to ensure you have more elbow room.</div><div style=\"\"><b><br></b></div><div style=\"\"><b>Other Activities at Grand Canyon West</b></div><div style=\"\">The Grand Canyon West complex lies outside the national park and is operated by the Hualapai tribe. In addition to the Skywalk, visitors can explore an American Indian village at Eagle Point, cruise along the Colorado River, hike to the ruins of an old guano mine, or even rent a rustic cabin at Hualapai Ranch.</div>",

                "overviewSummary": "The South Rim is the most popular area of Grand Canyon National Park, boasting easy access to the canyon, the bulk of available amenities and services, and the panoramic vistas for which the natural wonder is famous. One of the most famous attractions in the American Southwest, the area offers breathtaking views over the Colorado River and the chance to immerse yourself in Native American culture.<div><br><b>The Basics<br></b>The South Rim of the Grand Canyon averages 7,000 feet (2,134 meters) above sea level, with natural wonders including Navajo Point, Hermit Road, and the Abyss. Grand Canyon Village is home to a variety of historic buildings, while other popular stops include the Grand Canyon Railway Depot, the Bright Angel Lodge, Kolb Studio, and the Desert View Watchtower, which features work by Hopi artists and incorporates Native American art and design.</div><div><br></div><div>Choosing a group bus tour, helicopter tour, air tour, or a self-drive tour makes the South Rim conveniently accessible from Las Vegas. Tours also leave from Sedona and Phoenix, and some combine the trip with a visit to the West Rim, the North Rim, or the Hoover Dam. A Grand Canyon helicopter tour is undoubtedly the fastest and most dramatic way to visit the canyon from Vegas.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Things to Know Before You Go</b><br><ul><li>The Canyon View Visitor Center, near the south entrance, stocks maps, books, and videos, while the Cameron Trading Post, outside the east entrance to the park, boasts a selection of souvenirs and supplies.<br></li><li>Stop by the Hopi House Gift Store and Art Gallery to see art and crafts from the local tribes.<br></li><li>If driving, be sure you have plenty of gas in your car before setting out for the canyon; there are few service stations in this remote part of Arizona.<br></li></ul><div><br></div><b>How to Get There<br></b>Located in the Arizona national park, the South Rim is a three-hour drive from Las Vegas or a short plane ride via Grand Canyon Airport. Driving from Flagstaff, take US 180 directly to the South Rim or US 89 to Arizona 64 and the east entrance to the park.</div><div><br><b>When to Get There<br></b>The South Rim gets quite crowded with visitors in the summertime. Consider visiting in the shoulder season, or booking a South Rim bus or jeep tour so you don't have to struggle with traffic and parking.</div><div><br><b>Hiking the Grand Canyon South Rim</b></div><div>The Grand Canyon South Rim is home to the Bright Angel Trail, Rim Trail, and South Kaibab Trail—all of which offer the most dazzling views of the canyon.
