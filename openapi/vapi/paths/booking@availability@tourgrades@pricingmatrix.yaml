    Get a pricing matrix that includes availability and tour-grades for a
    product


    Given a month, this service returns days with available tour grades only
    (i.e., days which have at least one tourgrade available), and the pricing
    matrix for that tour grade for that day.


    - **Note**: Availability data is limited to a period of **12 months** into
    the future from the present time on the production server and **6 months**
    on the sandbox server.
