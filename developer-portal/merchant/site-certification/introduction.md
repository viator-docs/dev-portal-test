# Site certification for API integrations

As a merchant partner, you are granted access to our full API solution, so it is important that we certify your system to ensure that it meets our minimum criteria and represents an optimal API integration.

I.e., your interface, search criteria, category filtering, and booking platform should all mirror Viator.com to the extent that this is possible.

As a merchant partner, you are the merchant of record for your customers; therefore, you are responsible for transactions - including bookings and cancellations â€“ carried out by your customers.

During your integration phase, you will have been using an apiKey for the RC/sandbox environment, which cannot be used to make real bookings. Before we issue you an apiKey for the production API that allows you to make **real** bookings on our **live** systems, we need to certify your integration to ensure that it operates optimally from a sales conversion perspective and you're communicating everything to the customer necessary to meet legal requirements.

This section describes in detail what you need to do in order to meet this certification standard.

When you believe your site is ready for inspection, [contact the API onboarding team](mailto:affiliateapi@tripadvisor.com) to review your implementation and provide certification and feedback if necessary.
