# Viator API technical guide for merchant API partners

The Viator API provides merchant partners with a set of API calls that enable searching for and managing the booking of the experience products on offer by Viator's suppliers. This includes the full collection of products, destinations, user submitted photos & reviews, pricing, and availability details. All the functionality necessary for the construction of a complete tours and activities application, such as a web site, or integration with an existing application is made accessible through this API.
