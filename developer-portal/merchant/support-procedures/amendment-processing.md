# Amendment processing

We will process amendments unless:

- we receive the request to amend the booking(s) less than 48 hours prior to the time of travel, or
- the product is non-cancellable

If the product is *non-cancellable*, then bookings are non-transferable and cannot be changed; i.e., the name of the traveling party cannot be changed post-purchase. These are supplier-imposed restrictions and are out of our control.

If you receive a request to amend a booking within 48 hours of travel,   advise your customer to call the supplier directly to negotiate any changes.

Amendments can be either *traveler requested* or *supplier requested*.

Amendments are processed manually and should be sent via email to <a href="mailto:dpsupport@viator.com" target="_blank" data-wm-adjusted="done">dpsupport@viator.com</a>.

## Traveler-requested amendments

### ...to the name or date

If a customer wants to amend their booking *after* confirmation has been received, you should have your customer service team contact us via email – <a href="mailto:dpsupport@viator.com" target="_blank" data-wm-adjusted="done">dpsupport@viator.com</a> – making sure to include:

  - the itinerary ID of the booking (`itineraryId`)
  - the item reference ID (`itemId`)
  - the distributor reference ID (`distributorRef`)
  - the lead passenger's name and details
  - a detailed description of the change to name or date requested

We will confirm the change and update the customer's voucher directly – you will need to download the updated voucher from its URL and provide this to your customer.

**Note**:

  - If the change is *only* to the date or the lead passenger's name (and not to the product or price) there is no need to submit a new booking request. 
  - We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in the *names*, *titles* and *initials* of the travelers – these must be correct at the time of booking. While we do not charge an additional transaction fee to amend the name or date, it is important to note that *some* suppliers may not allow such changes. It is also very important that you *do not use placeholders* for customer names, as customers may be refused entry to certain attractions.

### ...to the product or its options, but with no change in price:

If your customer requests change of product or changes to its options when:
  
  - the departure time is more than 48 hours in the future, and
  - the price does not vary, and
  - the travel date is available...

...you should send us an email &ndash; <a href="mailto:dpsupport@viator.com" target="_blank" data-wm-adjusted="done">dpsupport@viator.com</a> &ndash; that includes the:
    
  -  itinerary ID (`itineraryId`)
  -  item ID (`itemId`)
  -  distributor reference numbers (`distributorItemId` and `distributorRef`)
  -  lead passenger's name and details
  -  travel date
  -  product name and code
  -  amendment request (name change, date change, etc.)
  -  reason for amendment

If the new travel date is both valid and availabile:

  - the amendment will be processed
  - you will be notified of the amendment's status via email
  - we will update the traveler voucher
  - you must send the voucher link to your customer

If the amendment was not possible due to unavailability, you will also be notified via email. The original booking will remain valid and will not have changed. If the booking is open to cancellation, you must submit a cancellation request as per the instructions in the <a href="#cancellation-processing" target="_blank" data-wm-adjusted="done">cancellation processing section</a>.

### ...to the price

In cases where the amendment request results in a price change from the original booking, you must first submit a cancellation request. A new booking request *is* required, and a new voucher link will be issued. 

The original voucher will thenceforth be invalid and irredeemable. It is your responsibility to verify whether it will be possible to cancel the booking in accordance with the <a href="#cancellation-processing" target="_blank" data-wm-adjusted="done">cancellation processing section</a>.

## Supplier-requested amendments

If a product supplier advises us that there has been an amendment to the customer's booking due to operation issues, weather, scheduling changes, etc., then:

1. We will advise you of the service change via email
1. You must advise your customer about the change

If your customer accepts the change, you need to let us know – we'll tell the product supplier that the alternative arrangement has been accepted by the end customer. We will update the voucher details on our end, and you must then issue the updated voucher to your customer.

If the change is not acceptable to the customer and no alternative is available, you must tell us so that we can notify the vendor and cancel and refund the booking. A credit will show on your next invoice. You must then notify your customer and issue the refund.
