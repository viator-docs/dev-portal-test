## Response times

We guarantee a response to all English-language requests within four hours.

When further information is needed from a vendor or further research on a claim is necessary, the final response may take longer than this; however, you will receive a response and acknowledgement within four hours.

For requests in languages other than English, we guarantee an acknowledgement or response within 24 hours. The final response will likely take longer than 24 hours, however, in case further information is needed from a vendor; or, further research on a claim is necessary.
