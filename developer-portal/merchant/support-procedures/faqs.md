# FAQs – partner support

## Booking process and documentation enquiries

### What do I do if I don't get an answer to my question within 24 hours?

We guarantee a response on special requests within 24 hours, and most requests are answered within four to eight hours. If you have not heard from us within 24 hours, please re-submit your request. We may not have received your initial request due to a technical issue, for example.

### Are all bookings confirmed immediately?

Products are confirmed at the time of booking with the exception of ‘on request’ products. If you have booked an 'on-request' product, you need to ping our system via the API to see if the booking has been confirmed by our supplier. This usually occurs within 48 hours of making the booking request (some exceptions might occur).

### What if the customer can't print their voucher?

It is essential that the customer travel with a printout of the voucher, which is unique to each booking and acts as a proof of purchase. The voucher must be presented together with valid photo ID upon commencement of the selected tour, and the client may not be permitted to join the tour without the voucher.

Tell your customer that they can always forward the voucher link to the email address of a device that does have access to a printer, (e.g., at work). 

If they simply cannot or will not print their voucher, we can also fax the voucher to the hotel of the customer, where they can collect it.

There are two voucher policies:

- **Paper voucher required**: The exact voucher must be printed and provided at the time of travel
- **E-voucher required**: Customers may present an electronic copy of the voucher (a printed paper copy is not required)

### What if the customer can't access their voucher link?

If the customer cannot access their voucher using the link provided, have them copy and paste the link into a fresh browser window and try again; or, have them forward the email with the voucher link to another email address and try to print it through another browser. 

If this doesn't work, send the booking details to us and we'll send it to your customer services team as a PDF, or fax it to the hotel of your customer.

### Is there a contact number at the destination for the customer to call?

Yes. All the supplier's details are located on the voucher under the heading <u>Important Information</u>.

### Does the customer need to fulfil any health requirements or have a passport or visa for this tour?

We do not offer advice or information on visas, passports or health requirements. It is the responsibility of all travelers, regardless of the passport they hold, to check with the appropriate consulates to determine if any visas are needed. As these requirements are subject to change without notice, it is recommended that foreign visa, passport and health requirements are investigated prior to travel.

## Pre-purchase questions

### Does Viator provide directions or maps from one place to another?

We are able to assist with any questions specifically relating to our products, but we cannot answer general travel questions. We do recommend that the customer contact the local tourist or convention bureau or an online provider of map information.

### Which hotels does a tour pick up from?

Hotel pick-up points should be listed on the product detail page on your platform, in the check-out path, or the customer will be advised (on the printable travel voucher) to call the product operator's local telephone number 24 hours prior to confirm the hotel pick-up details.

Relevant travel service provider details are located on the voucher under the heading <u>Important Information</u>. 

### Which days does this tour operate?

The days of operation of every travel service need to be displayed on your platoform’s product detail pages under the heading **Departure time**. 

The times of departure or operation should also be displayed on these product detail pages. This information is also available on the voucher for confirmed bookings.

### Are there different times of departure for this tour?

The days of operation of every product can be found on the product detail page under the heading **Departure time**. Please note that departure times are subject to change and reconfirmation for some booked travel is required prior to departure. If applicable this will be noted on the voucher.

### The customer is not staying in a hotel, what is the closest pick-up point? Do you pick up from private residences?

Most product operators do not pick up from private residences. The customer will need to provide the nearest main hotel to where they are staying, and enter these details as the pick-up in any booking. Alternatively, they can make their own way to the main departure point listed on the product detail page under the heading **Departure point**.

### Can a customer get dropped off after their tour to their hotel or in the city?

This depends on the travel service provider – they will need to be asked directly on the day of the tour. Most travel service providers can drop customers off at a major hotel or city location, depending on their schedule on the day. The customer will need to check directly with the travel service provider at the destination, prior to (or on) the day of travel.

### Where is the meeting point for the tour?

The meeting point for the beginning of every travel service can be found on the product detail page under the heading **Departure point**. Extra information may also be contained under the heading **Additional info** on this same page. If a client needs directions to this point, please advise them to contact the travel service provider 24-48 hours prior to their confirmed departure date on the numbers provided under the heading **Important information** on their Viator voucher.

### Is there any parking near the departure point?

If a customer is driving to their departure point, we cannot guarantee there will be free parking available. When the customer has a confirmed booking, there are direct numbers listed for the travel service provider on the  voucher. Please advise the customer to call these numbers and the travel service provider will be happy to help your customer with their specific questions about parking in the area.

### What time does the tour depart?

The tour departure information can be found on the customer's voucher under the heading **Important information**. If there is no time listed, the customer will be required to call the travel service provider at least 24 hours prior to the departure date to reconfirm the tour meeting point and departure time. This contact information is also found on the voucher under the heading **Important information**.

### What languages are available for this tour?

The majority of the tours and services provided by Viator are available in English only. If another language is available, this will be mentioned in the **Additional info** section on the product detail page.

### Does this tour pick up from the airport?

Most day tours and sightseeing tours do not offer airport pick-ups. Most city airports are located some distance from the city center, and tour operators cannot offer a pick-up service from these areas. If a tour does offer airport pick-ups, this information will be listed on the product detail page under the heading **Additional info**.

If there is no information listed, the tour does not pick up from the airport. The customer will need to nominate a pick up hotel they can access; or, alternatively, they will need to make their way to the main departure point listed on the brochure page under the heading **Departure point**.

### The customers want to choose different options in the one tour - how do they do this?

Each individual booking must have the same options selected for all passengers. If different passengers desire different options, the customer will need to submit separate requests for each option. That is, if there are two people travelling and wanting to purchase *Tour-1*, where one person would like *option A* and the other would like *option B*, the customer will need to choose one adult for *Tour-1*, *option A* and add to cart, then proceed to select one adult for *Tour-1*, option B and add to cart. The customer will receive two vouchers in this case.

## Questions about existing bookings

### Can tickets be sent to customers?

The travel voucher acts as the customer's ticket. It is essential that they print all vouchers and include them with all of their travel documentation. The voucher is unique to each booking and acts as proof of purchase. Customers simply present each travel voucher upon commencement of the travel service, together with valid photo ID for purchase verification.

### What happens if a customer 'no-shows' (i.e., fails to attend the tour)?

All product sales are final and entail 100% no-show fees.

### Does the customer require any sort of photo identification?

Yes, the travel provider may require valid photo ID, such as a passport, driver's license or another form of identification displaying a current photo of the lead traveler in the booking. This is required to protect the customer's purchase.

### What if some of the passengers (or children) do not have photo ID?

Not all passengers require photo ID upon departure. The main passenger in the booking will definitely require a passport as identification, or other valid photo ID in order to redeem their Viator voucher.

### The customer names on the booking are different from those on their photo IDs

Excluding non-cancellable bookings, this will not be a problem as long as the customer has some sort of valid secondary ID with the same name what that they booked the product under. If this is not the case, please contact us to amend the details.

### Where do customers exchange their voucher?

This information is found under the heading **Important information** on the voucher. This voucher acts as the customer's ticket. They simply present this at the destination stated on the voucher, together with valid photo ID for verification, and then enjoy their travel service.

### The customer needs directions to the departure / ticket exchange point

The meeting point for the beginning of every travel service can be found on the product detail page page, under the heading **Departure point**. Extra information may also be included under the heading **Additional info** on the same page. If a customer needs directions to this location, please advise them to contact the travel service provider directly 24-48 hours prior to their confirmed departure date. The relevant contact numbers will be listed under the heading **Important information** on the voucher.

### What happens if it rains, or if the travel service provider cancels on the day?

Unless the weather directly affects the travel service a client has booked, all travel services will operate as scheduled. In the case where a travel service provider cancels a tour on the day, please process refunds to the client at your discretion. Please notify us via email, including your customer’s details and tracking numbers, and we will note a credit in your account for invoicing purposes.

### What happens if when a customer gets to a destination and the tour is not running due to unforeseen circumstances?

In the case where a product operator cancels a tour on the day, please notify us via email, including the tour details and tracking numbers, and we will process any credits due in your account. As we have not received any payment from the client, you will need to coordinate any refunds on the client's behalf.

## Questions about changing, amending or cancelling a booking

### The customer needs to change the passenger names in their booking – what do they do?

Not all bookings can be changed. Please get the details from your customer and contact us via email with the current booking details (including tracking numbers) to see if it is possible to change the names of the travelers.

### The customer will not arrive in time to confirm 24 hours in advance, what do they do?

Reconfirming 24 hours in advance is 'mandatory' with some travel products and 'recommended' for others. Please advise the customer to refer to the instructions on the voucher for details.

If the customer will not be arriving at their destination in time to reconfirm within 24 hours, please advise them to reconfirm with the tour operator prior to this time, as departure times and locations may vary slightly. It is highly recommended that the customer receives this up-to-date confirmation *directly* from the tour operator prior to departure. All relevant details and contact numbers can be found on their voucher under the heading **Important information**.

### What are the cancellation rules for Viator bookings?

Most bookings can be cancelled without penalty up to 24 hours prior to the date of travel with the exception of products that are non-refundable.

### How do I change/amend a booking?

It may be possible to amend a booking; however, this depends on the type of amendment required and is at the discretion of the product operator. Contact us with the current booking number and specific details of the amendment, and we will be able to advise if the change/amendment is possible.

### How do I make a correction to the names, titles or ages in the booking and get a new voucher

Unless the correction is to substitute the lead traveler in a booking, there is no need to reissue vouchers for other corrections. If the customer has misspelt a name, not entered a title correctly or mismatched the name of a traveler with their correct age, you can send Viator Partner Support an email and we will make a note in the booking. Vouchers will not be re-issued for these changes.
