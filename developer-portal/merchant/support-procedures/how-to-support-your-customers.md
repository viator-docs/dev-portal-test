# How to support your customers

## 1. See if the answer is on the product description page

Normally, the individual product descriptions provided via the API contain all the information that your customers might require.

As such, more often than not, customers asking questions have not read your product detail pages carefully at all, and consequently have no idea that the answer they were looking for was right there in front of them the whole time. We update this content regularly, taking into account the questions that customers frequently ask.

We recommend that your customer service team members familiarize themselves with the range of information available on product pages generally, as this is the most effective first step in resolving any customer query. 

Questions are often asked about:
  
  - inclusions / exclusions
  - starting times and product duration
  - product options (tour grades)
  - pricing
  - terms and conditions
