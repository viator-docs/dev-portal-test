# How to contact us for support
## General support
### First-level general support

For first-line general support (general questions and non-urgent inquiries), we would prefer you sent us an email. This allows us to fully track and monitor all requests and inquiries.

Please send these support requests to us at the following email address: <a href="mailto:dpsupport@viator.com" target="_blank" data-wm-adjusted="done">dpsupport@viator.com</a>

### Second-level general support

Second-level support should only be used for bookings that depart in less than 24 hours that require urgent handling or require an immediate response.

Examples include the following scenarios:

- the customer has missed or cannot find their pick-up
- the customer is unable to retrieve their voucher on the day the product is operating
- the customer cannot make contact with a local vendor when it was necessary to do so

## Technical support
### First-level technical support

We offer full technical support to partners experiencing technical or connection problems with our booking services.

<u>**Please note**</u>: this line of support is not for booking-related enquiries.

Rather, first-line technical support includes queries about error messages or other non-critical anomalies in the functioning of the API. 

Our technical support e-mail is <a href="mailto:apitechsupport@viator.com" target="_blank" data-wm-adjusted="done">apitechsupport@viator.com</a>. Emails sent to this address will create a task and full log of the situation in our ticketing system, which helps us investigate the issue. 

Response times will vary depending on the nature of the issue but are generally resolved within 24 hours.

### Second-level technical support

Second-level (escalated) technical support should be used in the event of a booking failing to complete, or information being irretrievable.

The escalated technical support process is as follows:

1. Your technical support department should attempt to contact us to report the problem, preferably in this order:
    1. **Email**: <a href="mailto:dpsupport@viator.com) (include the word **"URGENT"** in the subject line" target="_blank" data-wm-adjusted="done">dpsupport@viator.com</a>
    1. **Telephone**: see the table above for the support number to call in your location
2. We will immediately triage and escalate the issue if severe. In the event that a booking cannot be processed, a 'Tier 3' (urgent) escalation will result, and work to resolve the problem will begin immediately.

### Critical system errors

If you need to report a critical system error, please provide as much detail as possible when contacting us, including:

- your name and the name of your organization
- the product-in-question's name and its product ID (if applicable)
- the apiKey you were using (if available)
- the date and time of error, or the time of the first notification of the error
- any error message text received (where applicable)
- a detailed overview of the service incident
