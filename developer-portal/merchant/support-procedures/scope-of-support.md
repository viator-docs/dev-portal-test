# Scope of support

As the merchant of record, you are responsible for all first-line customer support services to your customers, whether they're contacting via telephone, email or any other channel.

This is partly because we do not hold any personally identifiable information (PII) about your end customers, such as email, phone or payment details, so we're not in a position to help them if they were to contact us directly.

If your customers contact our general B2C customer service operations center, we will direct them back to you.

We're here if you need support from us; e.g., to amend a booking or get more detailed product information.

## Non-Viator product enquiries

If we receive inquiries about non-Viator products (for example, enquiries relating to other products you sell, such as air travel or hotel accommodation) they will be forwarded directly to the email address we have on record for your customer service team.

The email we send is as follows:
```
TO: email address:(Partner Service Center)
SUBJECT: "VIATOR"

The following request was received directly by the Viator partner support team. Please action 
accordingly and reply to your customer directly at <customer email address and/or contact details)>
