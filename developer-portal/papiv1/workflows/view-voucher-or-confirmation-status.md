# View voucher or confirmation status

The object returned by the [/booking/book](../../../../openapi/reference/operation/bookingBook) service contains booking details that can be used to display an order summary to the customer.

Confirmed bookings of freesale products will return a `voucherKey` and `voucherURL`. The `voucherURL` is accessible by the customer to view their voucher.

Pending bookings of on-request products will return `null` in the `voucherKey`/`voucherURL` fields. These fields will only contain values once the booking is confirmed.

A `bookingStatus` object is included in the response that contains the status of the booking.

```javascript
"bookingStatus": {
  "status": 1,
  "text": "Paid &amp; Confirmed",
  "type": "CONFIRMED",
  "level": "ITEM",
  "failed": false,
  "confirmed": true,
  "amended": false,
  "pending": false,
  "cancelled": false
}
```

The status field corresponds to a number described in [bookingStatus field values and meanings](../../appendices/#bookingStatus-field-values-and-meanings).

Boolean flags that you can inspect to determine the booking status of the item:
- `failed`
- `cancelled`
- `confirmed`
- `amended`
- `pending`

## Pending bookings
A booking is considered *pending* if the booking process is 'in progress'. For example, an on-request booking would be *pending* until it is confirmed/rejected by the supplier.

If a customer has made an amendment to an on-request booking that is yet to be accepted by the supplier, the booking would then have a status of *amended* when the supplier or customer service accepts the amendment.

## Checking the status of bookings

### Checking the status of a single booking:

- [/booking/mybookings](../../../../openapi/reference/operation/bookingMybookings) can be used to check the status of a booking after it has been purchased. This is useful for checking the status of a pending booking, particularly if there are multiple items within the booking.

  It is recommended that you poll the service no more than once per hour.

### Checking the status of multiple bookings:

- [/booking/status](../../../../openapi/reference/operation/bookingStatus) will return the status of all bookings, based on the following:
  - booking date range
  - travel date range
  - specific distributor/distributor item references
  - lead traveler date/first name

This is useful for checking the status of recently-made, but still *pending* bookings, or those that will commence soon.

**Note:** You can only poll this service (successful calls) once every 30 minutes.

## Confirming the booking via email

Upon receiving a successful response from [/booking/book](../../../../openapi/reference/operation/bookingBook), merchant partners should confirm the booking with the customer via email. This email must be sent by the merchant partner (not Viator).
